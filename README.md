# Machine_Learning_Project-Summer_Term_2025
This project focuses on predicting property prices in Florence using real estate data from the RBB (Registro dei Beni Beniari). The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that estimates property prices based on relevant features such as location, size, condition, and other key attributes.

## Files: 
- data_cleaning: Data cleaning, missing value handling, using geo data
- sentiment_analysis: with BERT on the reviews
- model_training_LG_MLPs: using Pytorch, Linear Regression and Multi Layer Perceptrons (4,5 and 6 Layers)
- model_training_LG_MLPs_PCA: same as above just with PCA before
- tree_models: RandomForests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
